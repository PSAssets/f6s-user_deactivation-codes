# Overview

This repository contains reason codes for deactivating a user in Fortress. It provides an XML of the reasons that we use in the compliance processes.

## Intentions

We share this XML to:

1.  help compliance teams integrate standardized user deactivation codes into their risk management systems,
2.  provide a reference for defining responsibilities around potential user deactivation scenarios and
3.  share our approach to the standardization of user deactivation reasons for Fortress.
